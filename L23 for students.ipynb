    "    - **New skill today: dealing with multiple data types in the pipeline using `ColumnTransformer`** <br> <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Optimize the model's/pipeline's parameters\n",
    "    - E.g. What is the \"best\" strategy for imputing? How should we scale the variables? How many neighbors is the \"best\"? \n",
    "    - Options: `GridSearchCV`, `RandomizedSearchCV`, and SK has some model specific `-CV` functions (e.g. `LassoCV`)\n",
    "    - Tip: print the pipeline to figure out how to specify the parameters keys for  `GridSearchCV` <br> <br>\n",
    "3. Try new combinations of X variables (which to include), X variable transformations (log, non-linear polynomials), and model types (e.g. regression vs logistic), and optimize each \n",
    "    - If you have 40 variables, there are $2^40>billion$ possible combinations. You can't check all of those!    \n",
    "    - Forward selection: \n",
    "        1. Start with empty model and add the variable that generates largest score increase (CV score, AIC, BIC, adj R2)\n",
    "        2. Continue adding variables until some stopping condition is reached \n",
    "    - Backword selection is the opposite. Start with all variables and remove the least helpful. Continue until some stopping condition is reached. Function: `RFECV`.         \n",
    "        - Alternate backwords approaches: `LassoCV` and `SelectFromModel`\n",
    "    - [`sklearn.feature_selection`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html) has a bunch of options and examples to show you different approaches for feature selection. Most can be used in a pipeline! :)\n",
